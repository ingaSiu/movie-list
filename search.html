                        ABOUT: The fate of the galaxy rests in the hands of
                        bitter rivals. One, James Kirk, is a delinquent,
                        thrill-seeking Iowa farm boy. The other, Spock, a
                        Vulcan, was raised in a logic-based society that rejects
                        all emotion. As fiery instinct clashes with calm reason,
                        their unlikely but powerful partnership is the only
                        thing capable of leading their crew through unimaginable

                        ABOUT: In 1818, high-spirited young Fanny Brawne finds
                        herself increasingly intrigued by the handsome but aloof
                        poet John Keats, who lives next door to her family
                        friends the Dilkes. After reading a book of his poetry,
                        she finds herself even more drawn to the taciturn Keats.
                        Although he agrees to teach her about poetry, Keats
                        cannot act on his reciprocated feelings for Fanny, since
                        as a struggling poet he has no money to support a wife.
